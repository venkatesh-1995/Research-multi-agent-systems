# 🚀 AI Multi-Agent Research System

An AI-powered multi-agent research platform built using LangChain, OpenRouter, and Streamlit that automates the complete research workflow from information discovery to report generation and evaluation.

Instead of relying on a single LLM prompt, this project uses multiple specialized AI agents working together:

🔎 Search Agent → 📄 Reader Agent → ✍ Writer Agent → 🎯 Critic Agent
